create new folder for server in which we will develop backend . backend should be in node,express , mysql2 create two tables "contacts" which will contain name (must) , company(opt) , email (must),phone_number(must),message(opt). second table will be "projects" which will contain image (must) , title (must) , description (must) , project image from frontend store on backend and in db store only path to image.


 handle other logics like validation and show proper messages and alert where necessary for better ux experience. Remeber i have already form for contact on front you just creat api and enter data to db ,in front i will update the api link by myself for javascript contact details  . also table should be migrate by js code not .sql file .
  i have contact form on front but on dashboard also show all contacts with edit and delelete like projects.
